# A Voir A Faire

# About:
This project is a community-run tourism website concept. It allows users to create profiles and add tourist sites they have visited in the past. 

They can add the site location, description, price and the date of their last visit to the site. Users who create websites can only edit or delete their own submissions. 

They cannot edit or delete sites submitted by other users. Only users with "administrator" privileges can delete and edit any website. All users who create an account on this site can comment on any site. They can share their experiences if they have also visited the site before. 

They can also rate the site on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Visitors to this site without an account can only view a list of sites on the site, they cannot add a site or comment on one.
